## Challenge 1

* Create a new Console app in Visual Studio 22, call it "ChallengeOne", and create it using .Net Core 3.1
* Remember all your code goes inside the "main" method (look at the code I sent and you wrote for where to start writing the code)

### Matching names 

Write a Console program that takes a name from a user, and then checks if that name matches the value of a variable

1. Create a string variable called `name` and give it the value `"pete"`

2. Print to the console `"what is your name"` 

3. Create a string variable called `guessedName` and give it an empty value `""`

4. Get the users response from the console, and store that value in the variable `guessedName`

5. If the value in the variable `guessedName` is equal to the value in the variable `name` - then print to the console `"Match!"`

6. Else print to the console `"Fail"`

#### Hints
1. To create a variable with a name and give it a value you use `string name = "pete";` and remember strings are wrapped with quotes

2. To print to the console we use `Console.WriteLine("edit text here");`

3. Create a string variable with an empty value using `string guessedName = "";` (putting open and close quotes with nothing inside means an empty value). We set this variables real value from what the user types into the console, on the next step 

4. Get what the user typed into the console and store it in the `guessedName` variable. To do that use: `guessedName = Console.ReadLine();`

5. Now we check if the value in the 2 variables matches using an if statement 
```
if (name == guessedName)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Match!");
}
```

6. And then finally if the names don't match, we have the "else"
```
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Fail");
}
```
