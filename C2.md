## Challenge 2

* Create a new Console app in Visual Studio 22, call it "ChallengeTwo", and create it using .Net Core 3.1
* Remember all your code goes inside the "main" method (look at the code I sent and you wrote for where to start writing the code)

### Car Speed 

Write a Console program that takes the speed of a car from the user, and prints out a different message depending on the speed

1. Create a `string` variable called `speedAsString` and give it an empty value `""`

2. Print to the console `"How fast is your car?"` 

3. Get the users response from the console, and store that value in the variable `speedAsString`

4. Create an `int` variable called `speed` and give it the value `0`

5. Parse the value from the `string` variable `speedAsString`, into the `int` variable `speed`
 * (Because we need the speed the user has entered as a number, not a string) 

6. If the value in the variable `speed` is `greater than 200` - then print to the console `"Fast!"`

6. Else if the value in the variable `speed` is `over 50` - then print to the console `"Quick"`

6. Else print to the console `"Slow"`

#### Hints
1. To create a string variable with a name and give it an empty value you use `string speedAsString = "";` remember strings are represented with quotes

2. To print to the console we use `Console.WriteLine("edit text here");`

3. To get what the user typed into the console and store it in the `speedAsString` variable use: `speedAsString = Console.ReadLine();`

4. To create an `int` variable with a name and give it the value `0` you use `int speed = 0;` and remember these are numbers (ints) now, so we don't use quotes

5. To parse a `string` to an `int` use `speed = int.Parse(speedAsString);` 
* notice here we are passing the variable `speedAsString` to the method `Parse()`
* remember parsing turns the text `"2"` into the number `2`

5. Now we check if the value in the `speed` variable is over `200` and if it is print `"Fast!"`
```
if (speed > 200)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Fast!");
}
```

6. Then we use an else if, to check the value in the `speed` variable is over `65` and if it is print `"Quick"`
```
else if (speed > 65)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Quick");
}
```

6. And then finally anything else we print `"Slow"`
```
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Slow");
}
```

* Note about these `if` statements; in code there should be no whitespace between the `if`, `else if`, and `else` so they should look exactly like:
```
if (speed > 200)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Fast!");
}
else if (speed > 65)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Quick");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Slow");
}
```
