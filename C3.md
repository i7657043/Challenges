## Challenge 3

* Create a new Console app in Visual Studio 22, call it "ChallengeThree", and create it using .Net Core 3.1
* Remember all your code goes inside the "main" method (look at the code I sent and you wrote for where to start writing the code)

### User Details

Write a Console program that takes the name and age of 3 users, and prints those details back out to the console (console is the black window that comes up after you press the green "run" button in visual studio)

1. Create an `array` variable of type `string` called `names` and initialise it with a size of 3

2. Create an `array` variable of type `int` called `ages` and initialise it with a size of 3

3. Print to the console `"Please enter User-1's name:"` 

4. Get the users response from the console, and store that value in the first index of the `names` array

5. Print to the console `"Please enter User-1's age:"` 

6. Get the users response from the console, and store that value in the first index of the `ages` array

7. Print to the console `"Please enter User-2's name:"` 

8. Get the users response from the console, and store that value in the second index of the `names` array

9. Print to the console `"Please enter User-2's age:"` 

10. Get the users response from the console, and store that value in the second index of the `ages` array

11. Print all the values in the `names` array to the console

12. Print all the values in the `ages` array to the console

#### Hints
1. To create an `array` variable of type `string` called `names` and initialise it with a size of 3 use: `string[] names = new string[3];` - the `new` keyword in that statement is something we will come to later, don't worry about learning that or now

2. To create an `array` variable of type `int` called `ages` and initialise it with a size of 3 use: `int[] ages = new int[3];`

3. I think you know how to print to console now so I'm leaving this hint out - good luck

4. To get what the user typed into the console and store it in the first position in the `names` array use: `names[0] = Console.ReadLine();` - remember arrays start at 0, so the first position in an array is 0, the second is 1, and so on

5. I think you know how to print to console now so I'm again leaving this hint out

6. To get what the user typed into the console and store it in the first position in the `ages` array we need to do a bit more...
- If you remember, because we can only get a `string` from what the user typed into the console, and we have to do use `int.Parse(string)` statement to turn the text into a number, we need to do that this time too (because our `ages` array is of type `int`, not `string`)

- So use `string ageOneAsString = Console.ReadLine();` to first store the age as a string

- Then on the next line in your code use `ages[0] = int.Parse(ageOneAsString);` to change that `string` (text) into an `int` (number), and store it in the first position of the `ages` array

3. I think you know how to print to console now so I'm again leaving this hint out

4. To get what the user typed into the console and store it in the second position in the `names` array use: `names[1] = Console.ReadLine();` - remember arrays start at 0, so the first position in an array is 0, the second is 1, and so on

5. I think you know how to print to console now so I'm again leaving this hint out

6. To get what the user typed into the console and store it in the second position in the `ages` array again we need to do a bit more like above...
- Use `string ageTwoAsString = Console.ReadLine();` to second store the age as a string

- Then on the next line in your code use `ages[1] = int.Parse(ageTwoAsString);` to change that `string` (text) into an `int` (number), and store it in the second position of the `ages` array

* remember parsing turns the text `"2"` into the number `2`
